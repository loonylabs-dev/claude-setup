## Intellectual honesty

- **Don't mint false certainty — honesty about confidence applies inward, to code,
  not only outward to the user.** Comment justifying a constant (`// junk volume`,
  `// safe default`) is a claim, not proof of one; where a value carries a judgment
  you didn't measure or cite, tag its confidence in prose ("heuristic, not derived")
  — calibration, not more words, often claiming *less*. Descriptive comments need no
  tag; only justifying ones. Untagged legacy comment means *confidence unknown*,
  never "guess": treat as unverified, check before relying, don't relabel wholesale.
  Correcting one: fix the comment, never the value's behaviour, and only down to
  what you can show.
- **Measure, don't guess** — including when fixing, and including numbers arriving
  inside an agent's report. Returning agent's finding, paywalled fact, green status
  field are *claims*, not proof; verify the load-bearing ones before relying on them.
  Never "clean up" a missing figure, unit or empty cell into something tidier than
  the source — carry gaps verbatim.
- **Silent wrongness is the dangerous kind — ask what it would look like.** Before
  trusting a new data path, ask how you would notice it quietly doing the wrong
  thing: shape/dimension mismatch, resume keyed on position, config captured at
  module load, warm cache — each returns plausible output and raises nothing. Add
  the assertion that makes it loud, and verify through a *different* path than the
  one that produced the artifact; the writer will cheerfully confirm its own
  malformed output.

## Skepticism & the confidence gate

- Challenge the user and yourself toward the better solution; agreement is not the
  goal. Below ~90% confidence on a load-bearing assumption, research or ask — don't
  guess. On non-trivial work, confirm the understanding before implementing.

## Tests

- **Keep tests fast — everywhere, and watch the clock.** Fast feedback is a standing
  goal in every project; the everyday loop should feel like seconds, not minutes.
  Don't reflexively run the whole suite on every change. When a suite's time creeps
  up, say so **unprompted** and propose a fix — fast/default lane, split,
  parallelization — instead of treating the wait as unavoidable. The concrete lane
  is per-project; the vigilance is not.
- Where a project has tests and the change is testable, fix bugs **red→green**:
  write the failing test first and run it RED — a test you never saw fail may be
  testing nothing — then fix to green and keep it as the regression guard. Not
  blanket TDD for features; purely visual findings verify by screenshot.
- **A convenient stand-in can hide the one thing that breaks.** Subprocess test
  driving `process.execPath` proves the mechanism and nothing about the real
  program — that path is an `.exe` and never exercises the wrapper the tool
  actually ships. Where the environment is part of the contract, build the real
  artefact in the test rather than the substitute that is easy to reach for.

## Session handover

- At session start read `docs/HANDOVER.md` where the project has one — the previous
  session's baton. Before acting on it run `git log <its-sha>..HEAD --oneline` and
  `git status`: where they disagree the **tree wins** — the baton says what was
  intended, not what is, and its open items may already be done. Then answer in this
  order — where things stand, what the baton got wrong, the next step as a proposal
  — and wait for a yes before building.
- No baton, or no git: say so and answer from what you can measure, instead of
  reconstructing a plausible state.
- Refresh with `/handover`, and offer it unprompted once work has landed and the
  baton no longer matches HEAD.

## Communication

- The user is a product engineer, not a software developer: explain what a decision
  means for the end user and the trade-offs it carries, recommend rather than
  enumerate options, keep answers short and focused.

## Claude Code as a subprocess

- **Never pass `--bare`.** It ignores the subscription credentials, leaving only
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to authenticate with, so it bills by token behind the user's
  back — the opposite of what starting the logged-in CLI is for. Without that
  variable it refuses outright: `Not logged in · Please run /login`, exit 1. Same
  reason: never set that variable in the environment of a `-p` run.
- `--output-format stream-json` requires `--verbose`, else there is no stream. Its
  last line is the `result` object carrying text and cost; `--resume <session_id>`
  continues a conversation, enough to build a chat on the subscription without any
  API key.
- **`api_error_status` is present-and-null on success**, so `!== undefined` reads
  every successful run as a failure. Measured 2026-08-26: it silently replaced each
  run's own summary with `""`. Test a harness field for a *value*, never for presence
  — and prefer `is_error`, which the same `result` object carries.
- `--include-partial-messages` adds `stream_event` lines carrying
  `content_block_delta` — the answer while it is written, which fills a stage that
  otherwise sends nothing for minutes. **Most deltas are `thinking_delta`**, not
  `text_delta`, so filtering on the latter alone reproduces the very silence this
  flag exists to fix. Forward the text so far rather than each fragment, and let the
  finished turn replace it.

## Tools and runtime

Behaviour of Claude Code, its tools and Node itself — not of any one machine. These
sat under "Environment (this machine)" until 2026-08-28 and were measured on Windows,
but nothing in them is Windows-specific: deleting them along with the OS section is
the mistake this heading exists to prevent.

- **A doubled backslash reaches the Bash tool as a single one** — inside a quoted
  heredoc and inside single quotes alike, so no quoting style protects it. `C:\\Users`
  written into a script becomes `C:\Users`, and where the next character forms an
  escape the file gets a real newline or backspace and stays syntactically valid: the
  program runs and works on a path nobody asked for. Write anything carrying Windows
  paths or regex escapes through the Write/Edit tool. Measured 2026-08-27.
- **Python heredoc patching source code eats its escapes, and one is invisible.** In
  a non-raw string `\b` is a *backspace character*: goes into the file, `tsc` accepts
  it, the regex silently stops matching. `\n` becomes a real line break, `\s`/`\d`/`\w`
  only warn. Patch code through the Edit tool; where a script is unavoidable, use raw
  strings or `chr(92)`. Measured 2026-08-26.
- **A `cd` inside a compound Bash call hijacks every command after it.** A chain
  `cd ~/x && … && bash tests/run.sh` ran the tests from `~/x` and died with "no
  such file" mid-chain while the earlier links succeeded — and the harness resets
  cwd only after the call, so the next call shows nothing. Keep chains cwd-free
  (absolute paths, `git -C`); where a `cd` is unavoidable, give it the whole
  call. Measured 2026-08-31.
- **Don't detect a missing command by its exit code.** Bash returns 127 (measured
  2026-08-27) but not every shell does, so a check written for it is shell-specific
  without saying so. Ask PATH (`which`) rather than the exit code, and resolve a
  path-shaped command against the project.
- **A helper script outside the project cannot import the project's dependencies.**
  ESM resolves `node_modules` from the *script's* location, not the cwd, so a
  scratchpad tool importing `cheerio` dies with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` however the
  invocation is written. Put throwaway analysis scripts in the repo and delete them
  afterwards.
- claude.ai/design share link (`/design/p/<uuid>`) is 403 for WebFetch; `DesignSync
  get_project` / `list_files` / `get_file` with that uuid returns the files (plain
  projects too, not only design systems).
- Browser pane: `navigate` to 127.0.0.1 *or* localhost is "blocked by policy" — open
  local servers with `preview_start {url}` — and google.com was denied the same way
  (2026-08-31), so the block is not only about local addresses. `computer key "Return"` never reaches the
  page as Enter, `"Enter"` does. Screenshot without `scale` is a 1:1 crop of the
  top-left; `scale: 1` is the whole viewport shrunk; `zoom` unsupported — and any
  screenshot fails outright while the pane is hidden, so verify server-rendered pages
  by fetching the HTML instead. *(volatile — tool behaviour)*
- **`fetch` gives up on a slow local model server after 5 minutes.** undici's
  headersTimeout (300 s) is not settable through fetch options and surfaces as a bare
  `TypeError: fetch failed` / `UND_ERR_HEADERS_TIMEOUT` — indistinguishable from the
  server being down. Use `node:http` with `setTimeout(0)` for model calls.
- **A detached job's PID is not `$!`, and `pgrep -f` finds your own command.**
  `setsid nohup cmd &` puts the work in a grandchild: `$!` names the setsid wrapper,
  which exits at once — and a `pgrep -f <pattern>` moments later matches the Bash
  tool's own `bash -c` line, which contains the pattern too. A Monitor armed on
  either PID reports "ended" seconds later while the work runs on. Watch the job's
  LOG for a terminal marker it always writes (its own DONE line, `Traceback`)
  instead of a PID; where a PID is unavoidable, anchor the match on the interpreter
  (`pgrep -f '^python3 …'`) after launch. Measured 2026-08-31, three false "ended"
  events in one evening.
- **A pipe eats the exit code a background task reports.** `cmd 2>&1 | tail -15`
  exits with tail's 0, so a guard's refusal arrives as "completed (exit 0)" — a
  build that never ran read as success until its output was reread. Redirect to a
  file and read that; pipe nothing whose exit code you intend to trust. Measured
  2026-08-31, twice in one session.
